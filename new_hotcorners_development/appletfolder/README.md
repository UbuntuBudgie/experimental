# Budgie HotCornersIII
Budgie Hotcorners offers the option to set corner actions for any of the corners or screen edges, from presets or custom commands. Pressure & delay can be set from Budgie Settings. 
Budgie Hotcorners is (as of now) a mini-app and can be accessed from the main menu. Additionally, an applet is available for quick access, switch on/off or edit actions.
