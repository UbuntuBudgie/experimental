# No Previews
Written on request - script to be used under a schortcut key, to switch through either all windows on current workspace & monitor, or windows of current application, without the visualisation of the previews applet.

## Set up

Switch between all windows:

- Set a shortcut to run the script by the command `python3 /path/to/nopreviews`

Switch between windows of current application:

- Set a shortcut to run the script by the command `python3 /path/to/nopreviews curr` (or any other argument will do)
