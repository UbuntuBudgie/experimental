# Budgie TakeaBreak

Budgie TakeaBreak is a pomodoro- like applet, to make sure to take regular breaks from working. Options from Budgie Settings include turning the screen upside down, dim the screen, lock screen or show a countdown message on break time. The applet can be accessed quickly from the panel to temporarily switch it off.
