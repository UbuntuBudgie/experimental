Budgie WindowPreviews is an application (applet) to show an overview of windows in an expose- like way. After the applet is added to the panel, two commands can be run from shortcuts. 

1] to show an overview of all windows on the current workspace: /usr/lib/budgie-desktop/plugins/budgie-wprviews/wprviews_window
