# Keyboard Auto Switch Applet

Keyboard Auto Switch is an applet to use a different input keyboard layout per application. Simply set a default layout to be used in general. Subsequently, simply set a different layout, with the application's window in front, and an exception for that specific application is remembered.

Exceptions can be removed at any time, either from the applet's menu or by setting the application's layout, again, with its window in front.
