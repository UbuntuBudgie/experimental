Budgie WindoMover is an application (applet) to quickly move windows to any of the other workspaces. Just drag a window to the bottom of the screen and a bar will popup, representing the workspaces. Click on any of the numbers (or press the corresponding number on the keyboard), and the window will move to that workspace. 

Additionally, instead or as an alternative to the applet, the bar can be called from a shortcut. The command: 
/opt/budgie-extras/wmover/code/wmover_run -single

To call the bar to move the desktop to another workspace (showing arrows instead of dots on the current workspace):
/opt/budgie-extras/wmover/code/wmover_run -singlespace
