# DropBy

The DropBy applet pops up in the panel on the occasion of connecting a usb device. The applet subsequently offers the option(s) to mount, unmount/eject, and, in case of a flash drive, to make a local copy of the drive's content. The info shows the free sapace on the volume.

The applet is *context- sensitive*, meaning: it only shows its icon in the panel if, and as long as, any usb drive is connected.
