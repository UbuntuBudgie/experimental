# Budgie CountDown

A count down applet with the following options: ring a bell, flash the (panel) icon, display a message window or run a (any) command. The applet also offers the option to overrule possible user settings on suspend, to keep the clock going while time is running.

The panel icon switches color, depending on remaining time; green, yellow (< 5 minutes left) or red (< 1 minute left).

The countdown label will be invisible until the clock starts running.

*Budgie CountDown depends on ogg123
