Introduction to Window Shuffler
-------------------------------
Window Shuffler is a window layout management tool.

A. Window Shuffler daemon

Running the windowshufflerdaemon, a set of shortcuts is added to the desktop:

1. Half screen tiling
  Ctrl + Alt + 
  - 4: tile the active window left half
  - 6: tile the active window right half
  - 8: tile the active window top half
  - 2: tile the active window bottom half

2. Quarter screen tiling
  Ctrl + Alt + 
  - 7: tile the active window top left
  - 9: tile the active window top right
  - 1: tile the active window bottom left
  - 3: tile the active window bottom right

3. Jump tiling
  Make the window jump to the nearest grid position in a defined grid*
  - Super + left arrow: jump to nearest position on the left
  - Super + right arrow: jump to nearest position on the right
  - Super + down arrow: jump to nearest position below
  - Super + Up arrow: jump to nearest position above

4. Tile all windows on current monitor/workspace in a defined grid
  Super + Alt + A

* Grid size can be set from Shuffler settings or be set in sync with Shuffler
  GUI Grid (below).


B. Window Shuffler GUI

When running the Window Shuffler GUI daemon, a keyboard shortcut calls the grid.
On click on one of the cells, the active window will move to the corresponding
clicked position. On hover, the targeted position becomes visible through a
semi-transparent overlay. Shuffler grid gui supports Shift-click to span 
multiple grid cells.

The grid size can be changed by using the arrow keys, while GUI is active:
- Add / remove columns: right/left arrow keys.
- Add / remove rows: down/up arrow keys.

The GUI can also be run from hotcorners.

Additional Other features % options
-----------------------------------
- Swap geometry:
  When using jump tiling, making a window jump to a position in grid where
  already another window is located, the two can optionally switch places &
  sizes.
- Max number of columns and rows:
  By default, the grid is max 6 columns x 6 rows. Optionally, this can be set
  to a max of 10 x 10.
- Synchronize grid size with GUI grid size.
  By default, the grid columns & rows, used by 'Jump' and 'Tile all' are
  synchronized with the last used grid size from the GUI. uncheck
  'Synchronize' to have 'Jump' and 'Tile all' use a fixed grid size.
